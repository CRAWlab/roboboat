# RoboBoat 2020
Repository of [ROS code](https://www.ros.org) for the [University of Louisiana at Lafayette](https://louisiana.edu) entry into the [2020 RoboBoat competition](https://roboboat.org). General documentation and development code is in a [separate repository](https://github.com/CRAWlab/RoboBoat-2020).

The goal is to keep this repository in a shape so that it could be cloned into a `roboboat_ws/src` or similar `src` folder in a ROS workspace, built, and run.
